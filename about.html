                  <h4>From pastries to Javascript</h4>
                  <p>Seless Lautzenhiser is a graduate of Johnson and Wales for Baking and Pastry Arts. She has 10 years of food service experience ranging from making burgers at Disneyland to creating beautiful pastry delicacies at a luxury retirement home. Seless has decided to take a step (or a leap, really) into web development with which she has very minimal experience. In school Seless experimented with different forms of art ranging from traditional pencil and paper to theater. However, she found her passion in graphic design and graphic communications. These years of experience in traditional art, design, and pastry arts has culminated in a very creatively inclined individual eager to grasp new concepts and learn a new trade. Her time in the UNCC Coding Bootcamp had been challenging but full of reward. She is one to constantly reach and seek out the next direction in her life, and this new direction is taking her to a whole new world of opportunity, and she could not be more excited.</p>
