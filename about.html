                    <h4>Seless Lautzenhiser</h4>
                    <p>Seless is a graduate of Johnson and Wales for Baking and Pastry Arts. She has 10
                        years of food service experience ranging from making burgers at Disneyland to creating beautiful
                        pastry delicacies at a luxury retirement home. Seless has decided to take a step (or a leap,
                        really) into web development with which she has very minimal experience. In school Seless
                        experimented with different forms of art ranging from traditional pencil and paper to theater.
                        However, she found her passion in graphic design and graphic communications. These years of
                        experience in traditional art, design, and pastry arts has culminated in a very creatively
                        inclined individual eager to grasp new concepts and learn a new trade. Her time in the UNCC
                        Coding Bootcamp had been challenging but full of reward. She is one to constantly reach and seek
                        out the next direction in her life, and this new direction is taking her to a whole new world of
                        opportunity, and she could not be more excited.</p>

                    <p> Pa graduated from Metropolitan State University, St. Paul, MN with her Biology and
                        minor in Chemistry. She is currently working as a Clinical Research Coordinator conducting
                        clinical drug trials. She has 2 kids and 3 dogs. She is always looking for new opportunity to
                        grow her knowledge. Her favorite quote is “Knowledge has a beginning but no end.” Geeta Iyengar

                    <h4>Shelby Kelly</h4>
                    <p>Shelby is a stay at home, homeschooling mother of three who dove in to web development as an
                        extracurricular. She learned basic coding skills as a child, and always had a love for design
                        and problem-solving. This made becoming a web dev a perfect fit. As an attendee of the
                        University of North Carolina - Charlotte Coding Bootcamp, the program has expanded her skills
                        exponentially. With an aim for front-end development, many of the user interface concepts
                        displayed here are designed by Seless and herself.</p>
