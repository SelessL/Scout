As a person who is interested in learning more about cryptocurrency

I want to be able to access a site that will allow me to access the current exchange rates for some of the top cryptocurrencies on the market

So that I can go into cryptocurrency exchanging with knowledge of current market values.

This site is a simple cryptocurrency search tool. When you access the landing page you will be presented with a dropdown box in which you can select one of the top 10 cryptocurrencies. The results will display in a box to the right along with a chart displaying historical data. 
This project is being created by Seless Lautzenhiser, Soua Xiong, and Shellby Kelly for the UNCC Full Stack Coding Bootcamp.
